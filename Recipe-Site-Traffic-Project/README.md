## Case Study for a Recipe Site

### The project is:
- __Tasty Bites__ is a subscription-based meal planning and ingredient delivery service that provides healthy and balanced meals to customers, regardless of their budget.
- The Product Manager of Tasty Bytes wants us to predict which recipes will be popular and lead to high traffic of the website 80% of the time and minimize the chance of showing unpopular recipes.
- Increase website traffic will boost subscriptions, which will drive higher profits.
