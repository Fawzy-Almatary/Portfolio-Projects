# 2021 BRFSS Data


### About the data:
- The dataset used in this project is the 2021 BRFSS Data.
- The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a collaborative project between all the states in the United States and participating US territories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
- It is used to collect prevalence data among adult U.S. residents regarding their risk behaviors and preventive health practices that can affect their health status. Respondent data are forwarded to CDC to be aggregated for each state, returned with standard tabulations, and published at year's end by each state.
