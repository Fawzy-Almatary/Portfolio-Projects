### FBI Gun Data Exploration and Analysis

-  FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System is used to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives.
<br><br>
- The data has been supplemented with state level data from census.gov.
    -  The NICS data is found in one sheet of an .xlsx file. It contains the number of firearm checks by month, state, and type.
    - The U.S. census data is found in a .csv file. It contains several variables at the state level. Variables just have two data point per state (2016 and 2010).
<br><br>
- __Questions to answer in the analysis:__
    * Is there a correlation between population size and gun purchase per capita?
    * What states were in the top 10 states in gun purchase per capita both in 2010 and 2016?
    * What are the overall gun purchasing trends?
